        watch, could watch again, but it''s hard to honestly recommend.\r\n\r\nThis
        is one of those movies that is good because it is bad, whether or not that
        is done on purpose, for the purposes of parody.  Otherwise it''s just a good
        old jump in \"The Way Back Machine\" to see a litany of cameos or cheap parts
        by almost anyone who was famous in the mid-1990s.  Though I do feel like most
        of the actors I liked were essentially wasted, but it is possible that was
        by design so the Martians could keep the focus for the majority of the movie.\r\n\r\nRethinking
        on the movie almost makes me want a modernization, it has so many little quirks
        and nuances that really brings it to a special experience.  Even if you think
        it looks terrible, throw this on your queque and slot it in for a Bad Movie
        Night.","created_at":"2021-02-23T16:52:21.762Z","id":"603532c597eab4003fd23f18","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:52.206Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/603532c597eab4003fd23f18"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":1}'
